# Lecture 14 - Mocking

Get started by running `git clone https://github.com/Sresht/lect14`  

## Set Up

1. Install pip dependencies such as `dotenv` and `tweepy`. If you don't know  
        how to do this by now, google it.  
2. Fill in your tweepy.env values with the right values.
3. Run the test five times: `python twitter_query_test.py`. Find out why it only passed a few times (if any).  
4. Think about how we might be able to fix this.
